# Mini-Project-3-NutriClass-Food-Classification-Using-Nutritional-Data

NutriClass  is a  machine learning project that classifies food into meal types using  nutritional values like calories, protein, fat, and carbs. It compare multiple ML models to find the most accurate and efficient classifier for nutrition- based  food prediction.

It has following four approaches:

   →Data Understanding and Exploration

   →Data Preprocessing

   →Feature Engineering

   →Model Selection and Training

DATA UNDERSTANDING AND EXPLORATION:

   ⁕Loaded the dataset

   ⁕Done some Basic Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to understand the structure  of dataset

   ⁕Done some visualize to understand the inter class variation

DATA PREPROCESSING:

   ⁕Handling the missing values 

   ⁕Remove the duplicates

   ⁕Normalize and standardize

FEATURE ENGINEERING:

   ⁕Label Encode

   ⁕PCA

   ⁕Train test split

MODEL SELECTION AND TRAINING:

   ⁕Logistic regression

   ⁕Decision tree

   ⁕Random Forest

   ⁕Recall

   ⁕F1 Score

   ⁕KNN(K-Nearest Neighbour)

   ⁕XGBoost

   ⁕Gradient Boosting Classifier
